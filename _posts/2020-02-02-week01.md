Initially I chose to take this class because I needed to fulfill my elective credits. However, now that I know what this class entails, I am intrigued to learn the contents of Open Source Development. It will be interesting to learn how others contribute to a project - how each individual adds their contribution and how it all ties in to make the project work. Learning that some softwares, such as Firefox and Android, are free and open source softwares surprised me as I was unaware that these were open source projects. I am excited to learn more in this course and what I can get out of it.
