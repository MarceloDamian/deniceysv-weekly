#### Which Project Did We Choose?

Erick, Jared, and I had a difficult time choosing a project. Jared and I had worked on two project evaluations together, so our options were pretty much the same. However, Erick was not familiar with the projects we had worked with and vice versa, so I believe that was our issue when we were narrowing our options down. Initially, we chose OpenCV, but the more and more we explored their repository and their overall program, we decided that it would not suit us well. Each one of us wanted to choose a project where we had some experience with the code languages already written in the program. We realized that this might be a little difficult and that we want and need to learn other languages. Finally, we decided to go with **freeCodeCamp**. 

#### Why Did We Choose It?

Jared and I did our first project evaluation on this and really enjoyed what it has to offer. It is a free platform (a webpage) where anyone can learn how to code. Whether it be JavaScript, HTML, etc. – there are many different selections for one to choose from and they can earn a certification from it as well. It is a resourceful project, and we think it was a great open source project for us to contribute to. I was especially interested in freeCodeCamp because of it focuses a lot on front-end programming since it is hosted on a webpage, and I am currently learning and excelling in front-end programming (HTML and CSS). So ultimately, I plan on putting my front-end programming to use by contributing what I know and will learn to the webpage of freeCodeCamp. I would like to make the webpage look more presentable to users. As of now, it is a simple design, which is nice. However, I would like to make it more inviting and I would like it to stand out more. I would like to add some designs and some color to the page.

#### Project Plan:

* [&#9745;]Forked freeCodeCamp repository into class organization
* [IP]Explore the freeCodeCamp webpage
* [IP]Explore the repository
  * Documentation
  * Issues
  * Pull Requests
  * Code (What/which code does what?)
* [X]Learning JavaScript – provided by freeCodeCamp's [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg)
* [X]Plan/Create a blueprint/template for what I want to contribute to the website
* [X]Begin programming
* [X]Create an issue to discuss with the community
  * What to do if not accepted?
  * Cooperate and coordinate so all is in agreement
* [X]Contribute to freeCodeCamp

#### Other Contributions

Aside from learning how I might contribute to freeCodeCamp, I have made three additions to OpenStreetMap:
1. I added a [Carl's Jr.](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/503319824).
2. I added [Fix Creamery](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/502786221).
3. I added a [U.S. Bank](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/471961767).

I have also been studying for the upcoming quiz as well as becoming more familiar with Git and its commands through [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/docs/git).
