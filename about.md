#### About Me
My name is Denice Veluz, and I am 22 years old. I am a Computer Science student at Hunter College and am expected to graduate in Fall 2020.

### More Information

I genuinely enjoy front-end development; however, through Hunter I have been learning back-end development. Other things I enjoy are graphic design, film editing, snowboarding, surfing, and skating.
