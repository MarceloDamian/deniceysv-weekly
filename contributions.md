|  3   | [link to contribution](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/81083657#map=19/34.05617/-117.18214)    | Added an OpenStreetMap Feature    |   I added a restaurant (Redlands Oyster Cult) to the map in Redlands, CA. It is a fairly new restaurant in the area, so it makes sense as to why it was not on the map yet. Thus, I added it.  |
